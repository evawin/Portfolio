  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Java Sorting Algorithms</strong><br>
    <p> Performance comparison of multiple sorting methods<br>
      This project focuses on the implementation of common sorting algorithms in Java.
It evaluates their efficiency and performance characteristics, highlighting the
strengths and limitations of each approach.</p>

    <strong>Mobile Applications Development Recipe Finder</strong><br>
    <p> Using Angular and Ionic, the user can search for recipes based on ingredients. It uses Angular’s standalone components and Ionic UI components to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Navigation between pages (Home, Recipe Details, Favourites, and Settings) was implemented using Angular routing.<br>
      An external recipe API was integrated which handles all HTTP requests and returns recipe data asynchronously. User inputs are bound to the application logic using two-way data binding, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface.
      Additional functionality, such as dietary filtering (vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free) and theme customisation, was included to enhance usability and exceed the core project requirements. The application was tested and debugged within the required virtual machine environment.

  <li>
      <strong>E-commerce Web Development</strong><br>
      <p> This project is a E-Commerce web application developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL. The application follows a client–server architecture, where Express handles HTTP GET and POST requests and serves both static and dynamic content. 
        Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are served from a public directory, while dynamic pages are rendered using EJS templates populated with data retrieved from a MySQL database. User authentication is implemented via a login form that validates predefined credentials 
        before granting access to the store. Product information is stored in a MySQL database and retrieved using parameterised SQL queries to prevent SQL injection. A custom Node.js module is used to encapsulate reusable logic, demonstrating modular application design. Bootstrap 5 is 
        integrated via CDN to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface. Client-side validation ensures required fields are not empty and that valid input is provided, while server-side error handling provides user feedback in cases of authentication failure or database errors.</p>

      <strong>Veterinary Practice Database</strong><br>
    <P>This project involves the design and development of a relational database for a proposed veterinary practice. The database is used to store and manage information about pet owners, animals, staff, appointments, medications, and billing. Primary and foreign keys are used to maintain 
      relationships between tables, and constraints are applied to ensure data integrity. The database supports basic CRUD operations and is used to demonstrate selected Codd’s Rules using SQL queries.</P>
    </li>
 
  <li>
      <strong>Text Encryption and Decryption Application Using Java</strong>
    <p>This project implements a Java-based text encryption and decryption system that converts written language into numerical codes using a CSV-defined lookup table. Words, suffixes, and punctuation are mapped to integer values and stored using arrays, allowing text files to be encrypted 
      into numeric form and later restored. The program supports basic suffix handling, safe handling of unknown tokens, and file-based input/output. A menu-driven interface allows users to encode and decode files using the same dictionary, demonstrating key concepts such as arrays, string processing, recursion, 
      and file handling without using Java collection classes</p>

      <strong>Agile Software Development</strong><br>
      <br>
    <p>The aim of this project was to refactor a simple banking application and develop a comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite to validate its behaviour.
      The focus was on clean code, testability, and extensive automated testing, following professional software development practices.</p>

      <strong>Multi-Router Network Configuration with NAT, DNS and RIP using CISCO Packet Tracer</strong><br>
  <br>
    <p>Involed the design and configuration of a multi-router network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is built using static IP addressing and includes multiple PCs, web servers, and a DNS server connected through six routers. Network Address Translation (NAT) is implemented to map private IP addresses to public addresses, enabling internal users to access external web and DNS services.
      Routing between all networks is achieved using RIP version 2, allowing dynamic route exchange between routers. A DNS service is configured to provide name resolution for all web servers, and each server hosts a unique web page to verify correct connectivity. The project is successfully validated when all PCs can resolve domain names and access each website using URLs, 
      demonstrating correct implementation of addressing, routing, NAT, DNS, and end-to-end connectivity.</p>

      <strong>Text simplifier application using Java</strong><br>
<br>  <p>This project involved the design and development of a Text Simplifier application and API in Java. The goal of the system is to simplify the language of a given text file by replacing each word with a synonym drawn
        from the 1,000 most common words in English (Google-1000 list), following the principle of using clear and simple language.
        The application processes a user-specified text file word by word and dynamically replaces each word with the most semantically similar word from the Google-1000 list. Word similarity is calculated using GloVe word embeddings, 
        which provide numerical vector representations of words based on their semantic meaning. </p>

      <strong>Building a website using an AWS server</strong>
    <p>This project involved building and hosting a WordPress website on an AWS EC2 LAMP server focused on Tizen OS. The site was deployed using Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, with a custom DuckDNS domain for public access. Multiple WordPress pages,
      plugins, blocks, and analytics tools were implemented to create a professional, usable, and fully compliant website. The project also required troubleshooting server, domain, and WordPress configuration issues, demonstrating practical cloud hosting and web development skills.</p>
