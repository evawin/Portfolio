      Project Description
      <br>
      <p>  Project Description
For this project, I developed a mobile recipe finder application using Ionic and Angular. The application allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients and apply dietary filters such as vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free.
The app was built using Angular’s standalone components and Ionic UI components to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Navigation between pages (Home, Recipe Details, Favourites, and Settings) was implemented using Angular routing.<br>
An external recipe API was integrated through a dedicated API service, which handles all HTTP requests and returns recipe data asynchronously. User inputs are bound to the application logic using two-way data binding, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface.
Additional functionality, such as dietary filtering and theme customisation, was included to enhance usability and exceed the core project requirements. The application was tested and debugged within the required virtual machine environment.
