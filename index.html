  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Java Sorting Algorithms</strong><br>
      Performance comparison of multiple sorting methods<br>
      <p>This project focuses on the implementation of common sorting algorithms in Java.
It evaluates their efficiency and performance characteristics, highlighting the
strengths and limitations of each approach.</p>

    <li>
      <strong>Text Encryption and Decryption</strong><br>
      Linux shell automation and scripting<br>
      <p>This project is a Java-based console application designed to encode and decode text files using a predefined token mapping stored in a CSV file (tokens.csv). The application allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface
        where they can choose to encode a plain text file, decode an encoded file, or exit the program.When encoding, the program reads an input text file, replaces words or characters based on the mappings defined in tokens.csv, and writes the encoded output to a user-specified file location. When decoding, the process is reversed, restoring the original text using the same token definitions. File input and output are handled using Java’s java.nio.file package to ensure efficient and reliable file operations. 
        The application includes basic error handling to manage invalid file paths, missing files, and input/output exceptions.</p>

      <strong>Mobile Applications Development Recipe Finder</strong><br>
      <br>
      <p> 
      Using Angular and Ionic, the user can search for recipes based on ingredients. It uses Angular’s standalone components and Ionic UI components to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Navigation between pages (Home, Recipe Details, Favourites, and Settings) was implemented using Angular routing.<br>
      An external recipe API was integrated which handles all HTTP requests and returns recipe data asynchronously. User inputs are bound to the application logic using two-way data binding, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface.
      Additional functionality, such as dietary filtering (vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free) and theme customisation, was included to enhance usability and exceed the core project requirements. The application was tested and debugged within the required virtual machine environment.

  <li>
      <strong>E-commerce Web Development</strong><br>
      <p> This project is a E-Commerce web application developed using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL. The application follows a client–server architecture, where Express handles HTTP GET and POST requests and serves both static and dynamic content. 
        Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are served from a public directory, while dynamic pages are rendered using EJS templates populated with data retrieved from a MySQL database. User authentication is implemented via a login form that validates predefined credentials 
        before granting access to the store. Product information is stored in a MySQL database and retrieved using parameterised SQL queries to prevent SQL injection. A custom Node.js module is used to encapsulate reusable logic, demonstrating modular application design. Bootstrap 5 is 
        integrated via CDN to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface. Client-side validation ensures required fields are not empty and that valid input is provided, while server-side error handling provides user feedback in cases of authentication failure or database errors.</p>
